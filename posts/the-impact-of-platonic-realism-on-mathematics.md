Platonic realism is a philosophical view that suggests that abstract objects have a real and independent existence apart from the physical world. This view has had a significant impact on mathematics, especially in terms of its approach to truth, reasoning, and proof. In this blog post, we will explore the implications of Platonic realism on mathematics and how it has helped shape the field today. 

## What is Platonic Realism?

Platonic realism is the belief that abstract objects such as numbers, propositions, and sets, exist independently of the physical world. This is in contrast to the views of nominalism and conceptualism, which deny the existence of abstract objects. Plato, who developed the theory of Platonic realism, argued that abstract objects were “real” in a sense that they had a transcendent, eternal, and unchanging nature. He also argued that these abstract objects were the source of all knowledge and understanding. 

## The Impact of Platonic Realism on Mathematics

Platonic realism has had a profound impact on mathematics and the way it is studied and practiced today. The view of Platonic realism suggests that mathematics is an exact science, with its truths and propositions being eternal and unchanging. This has led to a greater emphasis on mathematical proof and reasoning in mathematics, as opposed to more empirical or experimental approaches. This has also led to the development of various mathematical theories, such as set theory and logic, which are based on the idea of Platonic realism. 

The belief in Platonic realism also has implications for the way in which mathematical knowledge is acquired. According to Plato, knowledge is acquired through understanding the abstract forms or ideas which exist independently of the physical world. This suggests that mathematics can be mastered through contemplation and understanding, rather than through trial and error or experimentation. 

## Conclusion

Platonic realism has had a significant impact on mathematics and the way it is studied and practiced today. The view of Platonic realism suggests that mathematical truths and propositions are eternal and unchanging, and that mathematical knowledge can be acquired through understanding abstract forms or ideas. This has led to a greater emphasis on proof and reasoning in mathematics, and has also provided the foundation for various mathematical theories.
