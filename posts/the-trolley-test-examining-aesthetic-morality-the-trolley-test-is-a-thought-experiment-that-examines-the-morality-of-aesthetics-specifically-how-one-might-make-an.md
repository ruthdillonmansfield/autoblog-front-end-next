## The Trolley Test: Examining Aesthetic Morality 

The Trolley Test is a thought experiment first proposed by British philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967. It is a tool used to evaluate a person's moral judgments. The test is based on a scenario involving a runaway trolley, and the decision of whether or not to pull a lever that will divert the trolley to another track, thus killing one person, but saving five.

The Trolley Test has been used to examine moral decisions and to explore the concept of utilitarianism, which states that the greatest good for the greatest number of people should be the ultimate goal. It is also used to examine the concept of deontology, which holds that certain actions are morally right or wrong regardless of the consequences.

Within the framework of the Trolley Test, people are asked to consider their own moral judgments. Do they think it is right to pull the lever and divert the trolley, thus killing one person but saving five? Do they think it is wrong to pull the lever and cause the death of one person?

The Trolley Test has been used to explore other ethical topics as well, such as whether or not it is morally acceptable to take extreme measures to preserve human life. It has also been used to examine the concept of aesthetic morality - the idea that certain aesthetic choices may be considered morally right or wrong.

For example, one might consider the morality of the aesthetics of a particular painting or sculpture. Is the artwork morally right or wrong? Is it aesthetically pleasing or offensive? Does it evoke feelings of joy or sorrow?

The Trolley Test can also be used to examine the morality of the design choices made by architects, urban planners, and city officials. Does the design of a particular building or public space reflect the values of a community? Is it in line with the moral principles of the people who live and work in the area?

Ultimately, the Trolley Test is a tool that can be used to examine our own moral judgments and the aesthetic choices we make in our lives. By taking the time to consider these questions, we can gain a better understanding of our own values and beliefs, and make more informed decisions in the future.
