# Wittgenstein's Language Philosophy
Wittgenstein is one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his revolutionary approach to language has made a lasting impact. Wittgenstein's philosophy of language is centered around the idea that language is a tool that is used to describe, explain, and understand the world around us. Wittgenstein argued that language can be seen as a game, in which the rules are determined by the participants. He also argued that language is composed of an intricate system of rules and conventions that allow us to communicate effectively.

## Meaning
Wittgenstein believed that the meaning of a word is determined by the way in which it is used. He argued that the meaning of a word is not fixed, but rather is determined by the context in which it is used. Wittgenstein also argued that language is not a logical system, but rather is composed of an intricate network of conventions that allow for the creation of meaning.

## Use
Wittgenstein argued that language is not a tool for expressing truth, but rather a tool for expressing our understanding of the world. He believed that language is a tool for communication, and that its use is determined by its users. Wittgenstein also believed that language can be used to bridge gaps between different people and cultures, and can be used to create understanding and empathy.
