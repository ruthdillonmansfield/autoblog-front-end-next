## How Metametaphysics Affects Social Interactions 
Metametaphysics is a branch of philosophy that discusses the nature of reality and the ways in which we interact with it. It has been argued that its implications can be seen in our everyday lives, and that it can have a profound effect on social interactions.

### Shifting Perspectives 
One of the main effects of metametaphysics is that it can cause people to look at things from a different perspective. It encourages people to think more deeply about the world, and how their actions and beliefs can affect the world around them. This can lead to a more thoughtful and nuanced view of the world, which can influence how people interact with each other.

### New Connections 
Metametaphysics can also lead to new connections between people. By encouraging people to think more deeply and consider different perspectives, it can create a platform for dialogue and connection between people who might not have previously interacted. This can lead to a richer and more meaningful social life, full of diverse and interesting conversations.
